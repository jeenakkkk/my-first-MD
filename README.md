# What is Chatbot?
Definition: a computer program that **simulates human conversation** with an end user
- **Any software simulating human conversation**, whether powered by traditional, rigid decision tree-style menu navigation or cutting-edge conversational AI, is a chatbot
- Chatbots can be found across nearly **any communication channe**l, from phone trees to social media to specific apps and websites
- Not all chatbots are equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), but modern chatbots increasingly use conversational AI techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) to understand user questions and automate responses to them.


## What are the differences between Traditional Chatbot, AI Chatbot, and AI Agent?

| Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Traditional Chatbot | use fixed rules. the user can use the specific phrase “tell me the weather forecast.” The chatbot says it will rain |
| AI Chatbot | use NLP — natural language processing — to understand intent and respond more flexibly. the user can ask, “What’s tomorrow’s weather lookin’ like?” The chatbot, correctly interpreting the question, says it will rain |
| AI Agent | they can act, learn, and make decisions. the user can ask, “What’s tomorrow’s weather lookin’ like?”—and the virtual agent not only predicts tomorrow’s rain, but also offers to set an earlier alarm to account for rain delays in the morning commute |

### Bad Chatbot Example: Microsoft Tay(Thinkg About You)

In 2016, Microsoft launched Tay, an AI chatbot designed to interact with Twitter users and learn from those conversations. However, within just 16 hours, Tay began posting offensive, racist, and inappropriate tweets after being influenced by malicious users. As a result, Microsoft had to take Tay offline and issue a public apology.
Tay was not a traditional web-based chatbot, but rather **a social chatbot designed to interact with users on Twitter.**
Tay was built with the persona of an 18-year-old American girl. Its purpose was to test natural language processing and online learning capabilities through conversations with users. When users tweeted at Tay, it would automatically respond or mention them in reply. Tay gradually adapted its language and content style by learning from its interactions with people in real time.
