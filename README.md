# What is Chatbot?
Definition: a computer program that **simulates human conversation** with an end user
- **Any software simulating human conversation**, whether powered by traditional, rigid decision tree-style menu navigation or cutting-edge conversational AI, is a chatbot
- Chatbots can be found across nearly **any communication channe**l, from phone trees to social media to specific apps and websites
- Not all chatbots are equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), but modern chatbots increasingly use conversational AI techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) to understand user questions and automate responses to them.


**Traditional Chatbot vs AI Chatbot vs AI Agent Examples**

| Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Traditional Chatbot | the user can use the specific phrase “tell me the weather forecast.” The chatbot says it will rain |
| AI Chatbot | the user can ask, “What’s tomorrow’s weather lookin’ like?” The chatbot, correctly interpreting the question, says it will rain |
| AI Agent | the user can ask, “What’s tomorrow’s weather lookin’ like?”—and the virtual agent not only predicts tomorrow’s rain, but also offers to set an earlier alarm to account for rain delays in the morning commute |

## What is Bad Chatbot?
1. **(Inarticulate Answers)**
    
    The chatbot fails to understand user queries, often responding with irrelevant or nonsensical answers. This is typically due to inadequate natural language processing (NLP) capabilities or insufficient training data.
    
2. **(Overly Scripted)**
    
    The chatbot is programmed for a single, rigid scenario without considering how people naturally ask questions in conversation. As a result, it struggles to handle real-world inquiries.
    
3. **(Impersonal Communication)**
    
    Chatbots that lack a human touch often leave users feeling unimportant or undervalued.
    
4. **(Lack of Personalization)**
    
    The chatbot fails to recognize previous context from the conversation, resulting in repetitive, generic responses for every user.
    
5. **(Overchoice)**
    
    Presenting too many options at once overwhelms users and leads to decision fatigue.
    
6. **(Poor Error Handling)**
    
    When the chatbot doesn’t understand a question, it simply repeats “I don’t understand” without offering any alternatives, suggestions, or ways to get help.
    
7. **(Slow or Laggy Response)**
    
    Long response times or loading delays cause frustration and often lead users to abandon the chatbot entirely.
    
8. **(Low Engagement)**
    
    By immediately pushing external links, the chatbot disrupts the flow of conversation and drives users away rather than keeping them engaged.
