# What is Chatbot?
Definition: a computer program that **simulates human conversation** with an end user
- **Any software simulating human conversation**, whether powered by traditional, rigid decision tree-style menu navigation or cutting-edge conversational AI, is a chatbot
- Chatbots can be found across nearly **any communication channe**l, from phone trees to social media to specific apps and websites
- Not all chatbots are equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), but modern chatbots increasingly use conversational AI techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) to understand user questions and automate responses to them.


## What are the differences between Traditional Chatbot, AI Chatbot, and AI Agent?

| Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Traditional Chatbot | use fixed rules. the user can use the specific phrase “tell me the weather forecast.” The chatbot says it will rain |
| AI Chatbot | use NLP — natural language processing — to understand intent and respond more flexibly. the user can ask, “What’s tomorrow’s weather lookin’ like?” The chatbot, correctly interpreting the question, says it will rain |
| AI Agent | they can act, learn, and make decisions. the user can ask, “What’s tomorrow’s weather lookin’ like?”—and the virtual agent not only predicts tomorrow’s rain, but also offers to set an earlier alarm to account for rain delays in the morning commute |

### Bad Chatbot Example: LeeLuda

Luda was a Korean chatbot developed by the startup Scatter Lab in 2020.  
It was designed to mimic a 20-year-old college student and offered casual, friendly conversations — similar to chatting with a real person.
At first, users enjoyed talking with Luda due to her informal tone and empathetic responses.  
However, the chatbot quickly sparked controversy after generating offensive and discriminatory toward social minorities including hate speech against LGBTQ individuals and sexist remarks, despite its friendly tone. It was also found to be trained on real user chat data without consent, raising serious privacy concerns. Public backlash led to its shutdown within weeks of launch. The service was shut down approximately three weeks after its launch.

### Why is Luda a Bad Chatbot?
- **Security \& Ethics**: Luda violated user privacy by using personal chat data without consent and lacked ethical safeguards against harmful content.
- **Learning \& Improvement**:  Luda’s learning system failed to filter biases or correct inappropriate behavior, leading to repeated offensive outputs.
